#🚀 Excited to share my MovieVault Project built with React! at Error Makes Clever
This project was a hands-on journey where I applied multiple React concepts while making a fun and functional app.
🔑 Key Features & Concepts I worked on:
⚛️ React Hooks: Leveraged useState, useEffect, and useContext for state and context management.
🌐 API Fetching: Integrated with the TMDB API to display real-time movie data.
🔎 Search Functionality: Implemented a dynamic search to quickly find movies by title.
📄 Pagination: Designed pagination for smooth navigation across large datasets.
❤️ Wishlist Management: Added the option to add/remove movies from a personalized watchlist.
📱 Responsive Design: Optimized the UI to work seamlessly across devices.
This project strengthened my understanding of building scalable, interactive apps with React and gave me confidence in working with APIs and state management.
I’m looking forward to exploring advanced React concepts and building more impactful projects!
